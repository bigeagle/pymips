Implementing a pipelined MIPS processor with Python
====================================================

Abstract
---------
    
From http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.myhdl/1536/ :

    Hi everybody.

    this is the situation: I'm a student  with one subject left (and the final 
    project, which it's almost cooked [1]_ )  to get a dregree Computer Engineering 
    [2]_ at CÃ³rdoba, Argentina. This subject is computer architecture. 
    
    To pass and be happy I must implement a DLX/MIPS pipelined processor. I would like to get my degree someday in the rest of 2010.
    I forget what I ever knew about VHDL and I never knew Verilog. but I enjoy very much programming python.

    My gantt diagram says that I have a month to do this.  Do you think MyHDL it's my workhorse ?

    seriously, I'll be bothering here for a while. be patience. and thanks in advance.

    BTW, any open source MIPS-like project in MyHDL over there?

What
----

I must implement a `MIPS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture>`_ pipelined processor. 

How 
----

To describe hardware formally a HDL_ computer language is necessary. In my course 
the standard is VHDL_ but I need (because I have no time nor stomach to that kind of 
evilness) and want to use Python. 

So,  `MyHDL <http://myhdl.org>`_ is my option. 


When
----- 

In a very (very) short time.
